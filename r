Goal: Test whether distractor intrusions in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) arise from delayed attentional engagement, indexed by the target-locked N2pc. Participants: 12 volunteers (8 women; mean age 28.92, SD 8.54), normal/corrected vision, £25 compensation. Apparatus: 24-inch BenQ LED monitor, 100 Hz, 1920×1080; ~80 cm viewing distance; responses via keyboard on a Windows PC. Stimuli: Two simultaneous lateral RSVP streams (left/right of fixation), each frame containing one character per side (center-to-center eccentricity 4.5°). Characters gray (CIE x/y = .309/.332; 46.6 cd/m²), Consolas font, 1.3° height. Selection feature: outline shape (square 1.5°; circle 1.68° diameter; 4 px line). Target: a digit appearing inside the prespecified target shape; the other side showed a letter in the other shape. Digits from {2,3,4,6,7,8} without replacement per trial; letters from 23-letter set (A–Z excluding I, X, O) without replacement with the constraint that the same letter did not appear in both streams simultaneously. Timing and sequence: Fixation cross 500 ms; then 8–11 RSVP frames per trial. Each frame: 50 ms on, 50 ms ISI (10 Hz). Target position randomly at frame 5, 6, 7, or 8 with equal probability, left/right location equiprobable. The frame immediately before the target contained two letters (to prevent pretarget intrusions). Earlier pretarget frames were equally likely to be letter–letter or letter–digit (letter/digit side randomized). After the target, three additional frames occurred: on 75% of trials the first posttarget frame contained a digit at the same stream location as the target (intrusion-eligible); on 25% it contained two letters (baseline). The last two frames were always two letters. Response: After stream offset, a response screen identical to fixation remained until a self-paced numeric keypress; then an 800 ms blank ITI. Design: 10 practice trials, then 600 experimental trials (12 blocks × 50). Target-defining shape switched halfway (after 6 blocks); order counterbalanced across participants. Participants were told targets could be left or right with equal probability and that non-target digits could precede the target to ensure guidance by the shape feature. EEG recording/processing: 27 scalp electrodes (Fpz, F7, F8, F3, F4, Fz, FC5, FC6, T7, T8, C3, C4, Cz, CP5, CP6, P9, P10, P7, P8, P3, P4, Pz, PO7, PO8, PO9, PO10, Oz); online reference left earlobe, re-referenced offline to average earlobes; sampling 500 Hz; online 40 Hz low-pass; no further post-acquisition filters for ERP analyses. Epochs: −100 to 500 ms around target-frame onset; baseline −100 to 0 ms. Artifact rejection: blinks >±60 μV at Fpz, HEOG >±30 μV, other channels >±80 μV. Average EEG data loss 10.8% (SD 11.3). ERP/N2pc: N2pc computed at PO7/PO8 as contralateral minus ipsilateral waveforms, time-locked to the target frame. Analyses focused on trials with a posttarget digit distractor, split by behavioral outcome: correct target reports vs. posttarget digit intrusion reports; trials reporting neither were excluded. N2pc onset latency estimated on contralateral–ipsilateral difference waves after applying a 10 Hz low-pass, using a jackknife procedure with the 50% criterion of the average N2pc peak amplitude pooled across the two outcomes; statistics adjusted per Ulrich & Miller (2001). Mean N2pc amplitude measured 200–300 ms post-target. Residual eye movements assessed with HEOG difference waves showed no condition differences during the N2pc window (supplemental), indicating eye movements did not explain effects. Behavior: Accuracy was lower when a posttarget digit was present versus a posttarget letter: 36.1% vs. 77.2% correct, t(11)=11.39, p<.001. With a posttarget digit, 57.0% of responses were intrusions, constituting 89.2% of errors. ERP results: Clear target-locked N2pc components were present for both correct and intrusion trials. N2pc onset was delayed on intrusion trials by ~30 ms: correct 214.9 ms vs. intrusion 244.75 ms; Fadjusted(1,11)=13.93, p=.003. N2pc mean amplitude (200–300 ms) was significant for both outcomes (ps ≤ .001) and larger for correct trials, t(11)=4.31, p=.001. Conclusion: When the target digit was defined by a shape in bilateral RSVP streams, immediately following digit distractors caused many intrusions. Intrusion trials exhibited a markedly delayed and smaller target-locked N2pc relative to correct trials, indicating slower attentional engagement on those trials.
